# Configuration

Currently there are only two aspects you're able to configure when you're using TracEE:

* Permitted keys in the propagated invocation context
* Length of the generated invocation-Id and `sessionId`

## Filtering propagated context

If not configured otherwise, all TracEE connector modules gracefully accept incoming contexts,
pass them down to sub-invocations and post the resulting contexts back to the caller.
This behaviour is not always desirable, especially if the context may contain sensitive information.

This is where TracEE configuration kicks in. It allows you to configure each connector with its own accepting-
and passing-policy. These policies are called __profiles__. TracEE ships with a small set of standard profiles. They
are encoded within java property files.

The preconfigured profiles are shipped with the `tracee-core`.

You may create new profiles within your application or overwrite values from the tracee.default.properties file.
Just create a file with the name `META-INF/tracee.properties` in your application resource directory.

### Configurable Values

| Configuration key          | Description |
|:---------------------------|:------------|
| .IncomingRequest           | Comma-separated list of regular expressions. Each parameter name matched by at least one of the expressions will be parsed from incoming requests to the context. |
| .OutgoingResponse          | Comma-separated list of regular expressions. Each parameter name matched by at least one of the expressions will be written back from the context to the outgoing response. |
| .OutgoingRequests          | Comma-separated list of regular expressions. Each parameter name matched by at least one of the expressions will be written from the current context to each outgoing request. |
| .OutgoingResponse          | Comma-separated list of regular expressions. Each parameter name matched by at least one of the expressions will be parsed from each incoming response to the current context. |
| .AsyncDispatch             | Comma-separated list of regular expressions. Each parameter name matched by at least one of the expressions will be passed along with asynchronous dispatched messages. |
| .AsyncProcess              | Comma-separated list of regular expressions. Each parameter name matched by at least one of the expressions will be taken up while processing asynchronous messages. |
| .invocationIdLength        | The length of the generated invocation ids. To disable id generation for invocations, set this value to `0`. |
| .sessionIdLength           | The length of the generated session ids. To disable id generation, set this value to `0`. |


### Configuration resolution

Loading order:

* At first TracEE scans for __all__ `META-INF/tracee.default.properties` files on the classpath _in undefined order_ and combines them to a _default_-properties object.
* Then TracEE scans for __all__ `META-INF/tracee.properties` files on the classpath _in undefined order_ and combines them to an _application_-properties object.
* The order between each default or non-default properties files ist not defined.

Evaluation strategy:

* When a connector is configured with a profile, it will lookup the configuration keys with the prefix `tracee.profile.PROFILE_NAME.`
* When there is no profile specific configuration for a certain key, it will fall back to the default configuration of the key `tracee.default.`

If no profile is configured for a connector, it will always lookup the default value.

## Generate identifier for the context

Even if an binding handles the incoming invocation and no *invocationId* is propagated, a new one is generated by default. The length is defined with the `tracee.default.invocationIdLength` where the value `-1` disables the generation completely. For the `servlet`-binding the corresponding parameter `tracee.default.sessionIdLength` will adjust he sessionId as well.
