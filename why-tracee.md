In production, logs are still the most reliable source of information which can be used to analyze your application's behavior.
In times of microservices and service oriented architecture analyzing of logs is getting more and more complex.

Log servers like Graylog or the ELK stack are helping you to manage your logs to search the log files for interesting information by offering a simple user interface.

But there is one thing that the log servers can't help you with - they can't aggregate the log information that belongs together on their own. 

```ini
2014-02-11 15:35:04.127 [tomcat-exec-1] INFO
  my.business.webapp.Servlet - Calling the backend for user Alice now!
2014-02-11 15:35:04.128 [tomcat-exec-2] INFO
  my.business.webapp.Servlet - Calling the backend for user Bob now!
2014-02-11 15:35:05.999 [jboss-exec-15] INFO
  my.business.backend.Service - Everything went fine!
2014-02-11 15:35:05.999 [jboss-exec-21] WARN
  my.business.backend.Service - Something went terribly wrong!
```

This is where TracEE kicks in. It offers bindings for most popular Java frameworks, that will automatically generate tracking information like invocation or session ids and writes it to your applications log framework contexts.
Another thing TracEE does is to support passing those invocation and session ids between all of your components in your application environment, empowering you to gather all log statements that belong to a single invocation or session.

If you are using TracEE, time needed for analyzing your systems behavior - for example in case of an error -  will be drastically reduced. 

```ini
2014-02-11 15:35:04.127 [rxId:BABO sessionId:AFF3] [tomcat-exec-1] INFO
  my.business.webapp.Servlet - Calling the backend for user Alice now!
2014-02-11 15:35:04.128 [rxId:BABA sessionId:EEEE] [tomcat-exec-2] INFO
  my.business.webapp.Servlet - Calling the backend for user Bob now!
2014-02-11 15:35:05.999 [rxId:BABA sessionId:EEEE] [jboss-exec-15] INFO
  my.business.backend.Service - Everything went fine!
2014-02-11 15:35:05.999 [rxId:BABO sessionId:AFF3] [jboss-exec-21] WARN
  my.business.backend.Service - Something went terribly wrong!
```

Integration of TracEE in your application is very easy and done with almost no effort.
